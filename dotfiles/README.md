# 'dot' files

The files in this folder are meant to be installed in your home directory (`~`) and are used by `bash`, `git`, `emacs`, `vim` and other tools when they start up.
For instructions about their use, see the README in the parent directory.

**Note:** we may occasionally provide enhancements or corrections to these files; we may instruct you to copy these changes to your home(`~`) copy of the corresponding file.
